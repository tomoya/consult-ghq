;;; Commentary:

;; This packaage provides qhq interface using Consult.
;;
;; Its main entry points are the commands `consult-ghq-find' and
;; `consult-ghq-grep`.  Default find-function is affe-find.  If you
;; want to use consult-find instead, you can change like bellow:
;;
;; (setq consult-ghq-find-function #'consult-find)

;;; Code:

(require 'consult)
(require 'affe)

(defgroup consult-ghq nil
  "Ghq interface using consult."
  :prefix "consult-ghq-"
  :group 'consult)

(defcustom consult-ghq-command
  "ghq"
  "*A ghq command."
  :type 'string
  :group 'consult-ghq)

(defcustom consult-ghq-find-function #'affe-find
  "Find function that find files after selected repo."
  :type 'function
  :group 'consult-ghq)

(defcustom consult-ghq-grep-function #'affe-grep
  "Grep function that find files after selected repo."
  :type 'function
  :group 'consult-ghq)

(defun consult-ghq--list-candidates ()
  "Return ghq list candidate."
  (with-temp-buffer
